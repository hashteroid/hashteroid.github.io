# Whoami  
I've been working in the IT field just shy of a decade, and Infosec the last 5. Most of my time has been focused on architecture, engineering, and incident response. I work in Enterprise, and OT spaces.

In the real world, I am a practitioner of the Iommic Guitartial Arts. I attend a *lot* of shows. I pair all my posts with an **Album of the Day.** For the uninitiated, this is probably the worst music you've ever heard. However, if ya know, ya know.
